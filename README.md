# OTF_Backend_Task

This project was generated with Node JS v17.8.0 and Hubspot.

## Development Server

## You need to set the following configurations before running the project:
1. Run `npm i` to install node modules folder.
2. Create .env file and configure a variable called `HUBSPOT_API_KEY` with the key to connect to Hubspot.
3. Run `npm start`. The server will be running correctly in `localhost:3000/`.

## Test Server

If you want to test the server, you can go to Postman to check the endpoints.
For a quick test, configure a GET request with `localhost:3000/api/v1/users/`. The output will be a json with every user in Developer_test_3 Hub Database.
